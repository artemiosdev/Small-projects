## I am Rich

I built copy this a "I am Rish" app. 

"I Am Rich" was an iOS mobile application developed by Armin Heinrich that was distributed through the App Store. When launched, the screen contained only a glowing gem and an icon displayed the following mantra in large text:
"I am rich"

The application is described as "a work of art with no hidden function at all", with its only purpose being to show other people that they were able to afford it.

Eight people bought the application, at least one of whom claimed to have done so accidentally.
I Am Rich was sold on the App Store for US$999.99, €799.99, and GB£599.99, the highest price Apple allowed for App Store content. The application was removed from the App Store without explanation by Apple Inc. the day after its release, August 6, 2008
